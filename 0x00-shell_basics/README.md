# Shell basics üî•
This repository acts as a roadmap on the basics of system engineering and DevOps. This repo heavily uses shell programming language in exploring various shell aspects. The project is designed by [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/) to equip you with the neccessary skills to become a fully fledged Software Engineer.

* 1. [What‚Äôs in there?](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#1-listit) : Displays the contents list of your current directory.
* 2. [There is no place like home](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#2-bring_me_home) : Writing a script that changes the working directory to the user‚Äôs home directory.
* 3. [The long format](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#3-listfiles) : Displaying current directory contents in a long format
* 4. [Hidden files](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#4-listmorefiles) : Displaying current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format.
* 5. [I love numbers](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#5-listfilesdigitonly) : Displaying current directory contents in Long format, with user and group IDs displayed numerically, And hidden files (starting with .)
* 6. [Welcome](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#6-firstdirectory) : Creating a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory.
* 7. [Betty in my first directory](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#7-movethatfile) : Moving the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory.
* 8. [Bye bye Betty](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#8-firstdelete) : Delete the fiel betty
* 9. [ Bye bye My first directory](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#8-firstdelete) : Deleting the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory
* 10. [ Back to the future](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#10-back) : Writing a script that changes the working directory to the previous one
* 11. [Lists](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#11-lists) : Writing a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.
* 12. [File Type](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#12-file_type) : Writing a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script
* 13. [We are symbols, and inhabit symbols](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#13-symbolic_link) : Creating a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.
* 14. [Copy HTML files](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#14-copy_html) : Creating a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.

* 16. [Clean Emacs](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#101-clean_emacs) : Creating a script that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.
* 17. [Tree](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#102-tree) : Creating a script that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/school in the current directory
* 18. [Life is a series of commas, not periods](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#103-commas) : Writing a command that lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,).
* 19. [File type: School](https://github.com/Derrick-ndemo/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics#school.mgc) : Creating a magic file school.mgc that can be used with the command file to detect School data files. School data files always contain the string SCHOOL at offset 0.
