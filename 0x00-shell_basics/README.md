# Shell basics üî•
This repository acts as a roadmap on the basics of system engineering and DevOps. This repo heavily uses shell programming language in exploring various shell aspects. The project is designed by [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/) to equip you with the neccessary skills to become a fully fledged Software Engineer. 

### Technologies üñ•Ô∏è
This project is created with:
* Shell

* 12. [File Type](./12-file_type) : Writing a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the `/tmp` directory when we will run your script
* 13. [We are symbols, and inhabit symbols](./13-symbolic_link) : Creating a symbolic link to `/bin/ls`, named `__ls__`. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.
* 14. [Copy HTML files](./14-copy_html) : Creating a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.
* 15. [Let‚Äôs move](./100-lets_move) : Creating a script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory `/tmp/u`.
* 16. [Clean Emacs](./101-clean_emacs) : Creating a script that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.
* 17. [Tree](./0x00-shell_basics#102-tree) : Creating a script that creates the directories `welcome/`, `welcome/to/` and `welcome/to/school` in the current directory
* 18. [Life is a series of commas, not periods](./103-commas) : Writing a command that lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,).
