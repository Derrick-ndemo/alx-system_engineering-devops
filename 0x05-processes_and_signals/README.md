# Linux Processes and signals

<p>
<b>What is a Process?</b> A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. We called this an ‘instance of a program’, because if the same program is run lets say 10 times then there will be 10 corresponding processes.

<p>
A <b>Signal</b> is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.
A signal is just made like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.
