# Firewall ðŸ§±

A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organizationâ€™s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet. A firewallâ€™s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.
